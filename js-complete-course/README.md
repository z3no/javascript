# The fields: JavaScript

Welcome to the JavaScript folder.

## Structure

The file consists of several exercises, divided into 7 series.
Don't be afraid of the large amount of exercises: most of these exercises are very short and focus on a particular aspect.
The exercises follow one another in a logical _relatively_ way, but don't let one exercise stop you: go to the next, come back to it later.

Some exercises are marked as optional, feel free to continue with the next chapter and come back to those exercises later.

### Local server

Some exercises may require running the code on a _local server_.  
This is a good practice that should always be applied. Maybe, you have already install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/) on your machines. If not, do it ;). 
If you want to configure correctly the global settings of npm [follow this article](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally#manually-change-npms-default-directory).

We prepared for you a local server to use from your command line called [**sèvè**](https://github.com/leny/seve).

Then, use your terminal to *navigate* to your repo and run the following commands :

	npm install
	npm start

If everything ir right, your default's browser will be opened on the address [localhost:8000](https://localhost:8000).


### Section 11 - fetch

For the *fetch* exercises, you are going to need to query a REST API.
We have provided you with a small script to run this API locally.

Open a second terminal, then _navigate_ to the repo folder. Then issue the following commands :

    npm run api

From there, you will have a REST API available at `http://localhost:3000`
